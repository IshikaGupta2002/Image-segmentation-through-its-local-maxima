# Image-segmentation-through-its-local-maxima
The project Image Segmentation through its Local Maxima identifies high-intensity points in images to detect distinct regions and boundaries. Using gradient-based and morphological methods, it segments images efficiently, aiding in medical imaging, object detection, and satellite image analysis.
